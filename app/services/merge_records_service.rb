class MergeRecordsService

  # This service is intended to merge duplicate records.
  #
  # Example:
  #     old_reference:  "Joel Conway"
  #     new_reference:  "Conway, Joel"
  #
  # In this example, the service will find all objects with
  # references to "Joel Conway", and replace those references
  # with "Conway, Joel", and then delete the duplicate record,
  # "Joel Conway".
