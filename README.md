# Ingesting

(See also: <https://github.com/curationexperts/alexandria-v2/wiki>)

The descriptive metadata repository
(https://stash.library.ucsb.edu/projects/CMS/repos/adrl-dm/browse) is
automatically cloned to `/opt/download_root/metadata` during
provisioning.  Make sure it is up-to-date when running ingests.

The remote fileshare with supporting images is automatically mounted
to `/opt/ingest/data`.

## ETDs

The ETD collection is created separately from individual records.  See
https://wiki.library.ucsb.edu/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=16288317 on
creating it.

Once the collection has been created, `bin/ingest-etd` can be used to
ingest records:

1. SSH into the server and `cd` to the “current” directory: `cd /opt/alex2/current`.

2. Run the ETD script: `bundle exec bin/ingest-etd /opt/ingest/data/etds/2adrl_ready/*.zip`.

## Images

### MODS

Importing a collection of MODS is a two-step process.  First the
collection is created, then individual records with attachments are
minted and added to the collection.

1. Create a collection: `bin/ingest-mods ../mods-for-adrl/mods_demo_set/collection ../alexandria-images/mods_demo_images/`

2. Add the records: `bin/ingest-mods ../mods-for-adrl/mods_demo_set/objects ../alexandria-images/mods_demo_images/`

The first argument to the script is the directory that contains the
MODS files.  The second argument is the directory that contains
supporting files, such as image files.

### CSV

```
bin/ingest-csv <CSV file> [supporting files] [type]
```

The first argument to the script is the CSV file that contains the
records.  Optional arguments are the directory that contains
supporting files, such as image files, and the type: currently,
`Image`, `ETD`, or `Collection`.

Ingesting CSVs, like MODs, is a two-part process; first create the
collection, then individual records:

1. `bin/ingest-csv /path/to/collection.csv Collection`

2. `bin/ingest-csv /path/to/objects.csv /path/to/files Image`

#### How to specify the type of a local authority for CSV ingest

The CSV importer will create local authorities for local names or subjects that don't yet exist.

To specify a new local authority in the CSV file, use pairs of columns for the type and name of the authority.  For example, if you have a collector called "Joel Conway", you need 2 columns in your CSV file:

1. A "collector_type" column with the value "Person"
2. A "collector" column with the value "Joel Conway"

You only need the matching ```*_type``` column if you are trying to add a new local authority.  For URIs, just put them straight into the "collector" column, without adding a "collector_type" column.

Usage Notes:

* If the value of the column is a URI (for external authorities or pre-existing local authorities), then don't use the matching ```*_type``` column.

* If the value of the column is a String (for new local authorities), add a matching ```*_type``` column.  The columns must be in pairs (e.g. "composer_type" and "composer"), and the ```*_type``` column must come first.

* The possible values for the ```*_type``` fields are:  Person, Group, Organization, and Subject.

For example, see the "lc_subject", "composer", and "rights_holder" fields in [the example CSV file in the spec fixtures]
(https://github.com/curationexperts/alexandria-v2/blob/master/spec/fixtures/csv/pamss045_with_local_authorities.csv).


# Troubleshooting

- **Passenger fails to spawn process**

    ```
    [ 2015-11-26 01:56:19.7981 20652/7f16c6f19700 App/Implementation.cpp:303 ]: Could not spawn process for application /opt/alex2/current: An error occurred while starting up the preloader: it did not write a startup response in time.
    ```

    Try restarting Apache and deploying again.

- **Timeout during assets precompile**:  Not sure yet!

# Testing

  * Make sure jetty is running
  * Make sure marmotta is running, or CI environment variable is set to bypass marmotta
  * `bundle exec rake spec`

# Using Ansible to build production machines

We recommend using Ansible to create production instances of Alexandria-v2. Clone https://github.com/acozine/sufia-centos and symlink the roles subdirectory of the sufia-centos code into the ansible subudirectory of the Alexandria-v2 code:
```
sudo ln -s /path/to/sufia-centos/roles /path/to/alexandria-v2/ansible/roles
```
Review/modify ansible/ansible_vars.yml. If you're not creating your server on EC2, comment out the launch_ec2 and ec2 roles in ansible/ansible-ec2.yml, boot your server, add your public key to the centos user's authorized_keys file, add a disk at /opt if desired, then run the ansible scripts with:
```
ansible-playbook ansible/ansible-ec2.yml --private-key=/path/to/private/half/of/your/key
```
